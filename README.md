A personal finance management application that enables users to record, view, and analyze financial transactions.
The app will have two main pages:
1.Transactions Page — Manage all income and expense records (add, edit, delete, filter, sort, paginate)
2.Dashboard Page — Display summarized financial insights and charts.
All data should be stored locally in a JSON file and synchronized with localStorage.
The first version must be implemented using Vanilla JS, HTML, and SCSS.
